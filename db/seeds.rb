Today, it is the site of Broadway and Wall Street, the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty, and the home of millions of people, who have come from every corner of the nation and the globe.\nIn Gotham, Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace have produced a monumental work of history, one that ranges from the Indian tribes that settled in and around the island of Manna-hata, to the consolidation of the five boroughs into Greater New York in 1898. It is an epic narrative, a story as vast and as varied as the city it chronicles, and it underscores that the history of New York is the story of our nation. Readers will relive the tumultuous early years of New Amsterdam under the Dutch West India Company, Peter Stuyvesant's despotic regime, Indian wars, slave resistance and revolt, the Revolutionary War and the defeat of Washington's army on Brooklyn Heights, the destructive seven years of British occupation, New York as the nation's first capital, the duel between Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton, the Erie Canal and the coming of the railroads, the growth of the city as a port and financial center, the infamous draft riots of the Civil War, the great flood of immigrants, the rise of mass entertainment such as vaudeville and Coney Island, the building of the Brooklyn Bridge and the birth of the skyscraper. Here too is a cast of thousands--the rebel Jacob Leisler and the reformer Joanna Bethune; Clement Moore, who saved Greenwich Village from the city's street-grid plan; Herman Melville, who painted disillusioned portraits of city life; and Walt Whitman, who happily celebrated that same life. We meet the rebel Jacob Leisler and the reformer Joanna Bethune; Boss Tweed and his nemesis, cartoonist Thomas Nast; Emma Goldman and Nellie Bly; Jacob Riis and Horace Greeley; police commissioner Theodore Roosevelt; Colonel Waring and his 'white angels' (who revolutionized the sanitation department); millionaires John Jacob Astor, Cornelius Vanderbilt, August Belmont, and William Randolph Hearst; and hundreds more who left their mark on this great city.\nThe events and people who crowd these pages guarantee that this is no mere local history. It is in fact a portrait of the heart and soul of America, and a book that will mesmerize everyone interested in the peaks and valleys of American life as found in the greatest city on earth. Gotham is a dazzling read, a fast-paced, brilliant narrative that carries the reader along as it threads hundreds of stories into one great blockbuster of a book.", genre: 'History')

Review.create!(book: horse_boy, user: simon, title: "magnificent", content: "In this classical, C.S. Lewis takes us again in the imaginary rich Narnian lands. Shasta (the boy) is the main character, and I like the notion that he plays, of being predestined. Aslan is present, albeit he's not always shown as the kids-friendly lion we've known in previous book. Something that catches my attention is that normally humans posses horses, and not the other way around as the title suggests. I wonder exactly why Lewis chose that. The horse to me is a rather secondary character in the plot.\nAll in all, a magnificent story for children and grown-ups alike.", star_rating: "5")
Review.create!(book: horse_boy, user: john, title: "Half way through..", content: "The first two Narnia books were awesome.

Review.create!(book: horse_boy, user: simon, title: "Lewis' best Narnia book", content: "Lewis' best Narnia book, hands-down! I've often wondered why I love this book best (and I've read the whole series several times and The Horse and His Boy several more times). It's very hard to pin down, but one strength is that it is all set in-world, letting us get to know the settings and characters more intimately, perhaps. It's a satisfying coming-of-age story, and has many small, satisfying details scattered throughout like chocolate chips in a cookie: descriptions of sumptuous meals or of the sea in the distance or of a difficult gallop across the desert. The Pevensie children have fun cameos.\nSuch a fun, satisfying read!", star_rating: "5")
